                <li>Routinely analyzing other apps will help come up wth better design ideas.
                    When designing, it's also important to know the intent and the audience.</li>
                <li>I liked how the article had gifs of sample apps and written out observations of them.</li>
                <li>"Know the rules, so you can break em"</li>
                <li>9/10 Interesting article, but the things were kinda familiar to me so wish there were things explained more in depth.</li>
