							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								Padding/white space is super important as it brings visual clarity and balance to a layout.
								White spaces aloow user to focus on main content that the developer wants to put emphasis on.
								Strategically placed white space helps our user navigate the visual noise on this page and potentially increases conversion.
								White space plays a huge role in the visual organization of a page and increases readability.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								It's interesting to see how Wayfair uses multiple of 8 pixels when spacing things out.
								It's also interessting to see how less visual noise makes for a better user experience.
								I also really liked how the article showed comparisons of when there are enought white spaces when there're not.

								"Think you’re using too much white space? There’s a good chance you’re not. If anything, you’re probably not using
								enough. When in doubt, add more white space…"
