							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								Before starting anything, we should first identify the purpose of your design. 
								(What information do you want to convey? What is the medium for your design?)
								And when chosing type of a font, we should try to empathize the users.
								Good font pairing helps establish visual hierarchy and improve the readability of your designs.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								I loved how the articles lists useful resources for getting free fonts.
								Also how they put images of the website with different font to show how determining what types of fonts to use is important.
								And how it emphasized the importance of having a clear core purpose of the website we're building.
